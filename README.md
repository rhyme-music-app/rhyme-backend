## Introduction

Databases are the general means of storing data in large-scale applications
as well as small- and medium-sized ones. In the **Database course (INT2211E-25)**
at UET-VNU, we are taught the importance roles of databases and how to take
advantage of them. To acquire a better understanding of databases and their
applications, we together formed a team to make this web app, **Rhyme**, which
is a music web service with basic functionality, using a **MySQL database**
under the hood.

This repository holds the backend of the app. The frontend is housed at:
