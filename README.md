## Introduction

Databases are the general means of storing data in large-scale applications as well as small- and medium-sized ones.
In the **Database course (INT2211E-25)** at UET-VNU, we are taught the importance roles of databases and how to take advantage of them.
To acquire a better understanding of databases and their applications, we together formed a team to make this web app, **Rhyme**, which is a music web service with basic functionality, using a **MySQL database** under the hood.
